Welcome to paperplanning hub for May et al 2024!

* Final dataset can be found at GEO acession number XXXX - the final dataset used in the paper is file may2024.rds

For more specific breakdowns of certain analysis see files below:
* Cellranger_output_to_final_dataset: Supplemental Figure S2, take cellranger outputs found in may_2024_raw and process through seurat to generate may2024.rds 
* Salivary_vs_Epidermal: Figure 1C and 1D, load in may2024.rds and compare marker genes between salivary gland and epidermal sorted cells. Generates tables used for lit review
* Cell_type_markers: Figure 2, load in may2024.rds, generates tables for cluster markers and plots them on the may2024 UMAP
